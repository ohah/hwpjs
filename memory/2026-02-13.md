Today, the assistant worked on addressing warnings in the `hwp-core` package under the `hwpjs` workspace. Specifically, the issue involved unused variable assignments (`has_image = true;`) in the `table.rs` file located in the `viewer/markdown/document/bodytext/` subdirectory. Attempts to edit these assignments faced challenges due to multiple occurrences, making precise replacements difficult.

Progress Summary:
1. **Initial Context Review**: Performed a detailed `read` of the `table.rs` file to locate warnings caused by repeated assignments.
2. **Editing Attempts**: Each attempt to remove or replace `has_image = true;` failed due to lack of unique context for each occurrence.

Next Steps:
- Further isolate specific contexts of each `has_image = true;` assignment to allow targeted editing.
- Clarify logic around unused assignments to ensure no functionality is affected when removing these lines.
